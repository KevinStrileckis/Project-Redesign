# Project-Redesign
Named after the malware practice of redesigning harmful programs to make new ones, this game involves students playing as cyber cops and robbers, building dangerous programs, stealing data, hiding data, and investigating for the stolen data.

As of 12-13, this game is in its development stage, having only most of the client-server system established, the main UI for cop and criminal, and the UI for the memory card game. Run the executables in the "Server Project" and "Red - Forms" folders.
